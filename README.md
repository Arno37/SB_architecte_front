## About

SB_architecte_front is a React-based frontend application that interacts with the backend server to provide architectural design services.

## Backend Repository

The backend server for this project can be found at [SB_architecte_back - Backend Repository](https://github.com/Arno37/SB_architecte_back). Make sure to set up and run the backend server before using this frontend application.

## Getting Started

To run this frontend application locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.

Ensure that the backend server is running and properly configured to handle requests from this frontend application.

## Deployment

This application is configured to deploy on GitHub Pages. However, since it requires a backend server to function, you will need to deploy the backend separately on a suitable hosting service.

For production deployment, consider using a cloud provider like Heroku or AWS to host both the frontend and backend parts of your application.
